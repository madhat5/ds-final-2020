#### Summary: 

- What will the visualization look like? Will it be interactive? If so, how?
- How will the data need to be mapped to the visual elements?
- For that mapping, what needs to be done to the data? Be specific and clear. Will it require filtering, aggregation, restructuring, and/or something else? How will this be done?
- What is the default view (if any)?
- What assumptions are you making about the user?
